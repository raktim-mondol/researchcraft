# Local Models with Ollama

You can run ResearchCraft entirely against local models served by [Ollama](https://ollama.com) - no OpenRouter key required for those models. This is useful if you want to keep everything on your machine or experiment without spending on API calls.

## Setup

1. **Install Ollama and start the daemon:**

   ```bash
   # macOS / Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ollama serve
   ```

   On Windows, download and run the installer from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) — it starts the daemon for you.

2. **Pull one or more models:**

   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen3.6
   ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
   ```

3. **(Optional) Custom Ollama host.** If your Ollama server lives somewhere other than `http://localhost:11434`, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in the repo-root `.env`.

4. **Pick the model in the app.** Open the model dropdown in the chat input. Pulled models appear under the **Local (Ollama)** section at the bottom. Picking one routes ResearchCraft - and any subagents it spawns - through your local daemon.

The list is populated live from Ollama's `GET /api/tags` endpoint (via the backend's `/ollama/models` route), so pulling a new model and re-opening the dropdown is enough - no app restart needed.

To make a local model the default for every new chat, set in `.env`:

```bash
DEFAULT_MODEL_PROVIDER="ollama"
DEFAULT_MODEL_ID="llama3"   # any model you've pulled
```

## Caveats

Local models are fully supported, but skill-heavy work leans on model quality (see [Known limitations](./limitations.md)):

- **Tool-calling fidelity is noticeably weaker** on sub-frontier models.
- **Skills that rely on multi-tool choreography** (running scripts, chaining file edits, producing structured output) are the most fragile.

If a task loops or ignores its skill, try a **larger local model** (or temporarily switch back to an OpenRouter-hosted model) before assuming the workflow is broken.
