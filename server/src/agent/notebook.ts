/**
 * Native `notebook` tool: ResearchCraft logs its own research narrative as structured
 * lab-notebook entries (hypothesis / method / observation / decision / note).
 *
 * Modeled on the `interview` tool, but NON-BLOCKING: it validates, server-
 * stamps (id = toolCallId, timestamp, role), appends to the durable store,
 * and returns immediately so the run keeps flowing. The entry rides the normal
 * `tool_start` SSE frame (tool name "notebook", args = the entry), which the
 * center-panel Lab Notebook view renders live.
 *
 * In-process custom tool → seen only by the lead agent, not by pi-subagents'
 * child `pi` processes (a Phase 5 follow-on promotes it to a Pi package).
