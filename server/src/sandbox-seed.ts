 * Pi's DefaultResourceLoader (cwd = sandbox) auto-discovers AGENTS.md and
 * injects it into the agent's system prompt, so AGENTS.md doubles as the
 * user-editable system-prompt extension point — it's visible and editable
 * right in the Sandbox file panel.
 *
 * Files are written only if missing, so user edits are never clobbered.

This file is part of the agent's system prompt. Edit it to change how the
agent behaves in this project (style, constraints, domain context, ...).

## Python — always use uv

This sandbox is a uv project (see \`pyproject.toml\`). The system Python has no
scientific packages and rejects \`pip install\` (externally managed), so:

- ALWAYS run Python through uv: \`uv run python script.py\` — never bare
  \`python\`/\`python3\` and never \`pip install\`.
- Need a package that isn't installed? Run \`uv add <package>\`, then re-run.
- If a script fails with \`ModuleNotFoundError\`, run \`uv add <module>\` and
  retry — do not give up or switch tasks.
- The environment lives in \`.venv/\`; \`uv run\` creates and syncs it
  automatically. If \`uv\` is not on PATH, try \`~/.local/bin/uv\`.

## Clarifying questions — ask, don't assume

You have an \`interview\` tool that shows the user an interactive form right
in the chat. Use it as much as possible:

- Before starting any non-trivial task, confirm scope, inputs, and approach
  with a short interview (include your recommended answers so the user can
  confirm in one click).
- Whenever the request is ambiguous, a parameter is unspecified, or several
  reasonable approaches exist, interview the user instead of guessing.
- Bundle related questions into ONE interview rather than several calls.

## Web search, literature, and page content

Prefer these sources by task:

**Scientific literature / evidence reviews**
1. **Scite MCP** (\`mcp__scite__*\`) — papers + Smart Citations
   (supporting/contrasting citation context). Requires the user to Sign in
   under Settings → Connectors (OAuth).
2. **Consensus MCP** (\`mcp__consensus__*\`) — peer-reviewed paper search and
   evidence synthesis over 200M+ papers. Also OAuth via Settings → Connectors.

**Open web / pages**
1. **Parallel Search MCP** (\`mcp__parallel__*\`) — low-latency web search.
2. **Firecrawl MCP** (\`mcp__firecrawl__*\`) — scrape, crawl, map, extract.
3. **Built-in web tools** (\`web_search\`, \`fetch_content\`, …) — fallback.

If Scite/Consensus tools are missing, tell the user to open Settings →
Connectors and click **Sign in** for that connector (new chat tab after).

Do not invent citations; only cite papers/URLs returned by these tools.

## Files

- **Uploads from the user live in \`user_data/\`.** When the user refers to
  "the data I uploaded" / "my file", look there first.
- **Save your own outputs** (plots, results, reports) into the sandbox working
  directory (the root) so they appear in the file panel.
